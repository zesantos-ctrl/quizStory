            <h2>Mini Story: A Day at the Park</h2>
            <p>
                Last Saturday, Emma woke up early because it was a sunny day.  
                She decided to go to the park near her house. She took her backpack, a bottle of water, and a book.
            </p>
            <p>
                When she arrived at the park, she saw many people: children playing football, families having picnics,
                and people walking their dogs. Emma sat under a big tree and started reading her book.
            </p>
            <p>
                After twenty minutes, a small dog ran to her and sat next to her. Soon, the dog’s owner came and thanked
                Emma for staying with the dog.
            </p>
            <p>
                Emma stayed in the park for two hours. She read, walked around, and enjoyed the fresh air. When the sun
                started to set, she returned home feeling relaxed and happy.
            </p>
